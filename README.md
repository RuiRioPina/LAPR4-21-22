  <h3 align="center">SS4I Warehouse/Online Shop Management Software</h3>

  <p align="center">
   Development of a products orders (and
sell) management system (from now on referred to as SPOMS) having in mind two distinctive aspects:
• The products being sold are stored in a (almost) fully robotized warehouse where customized
automated guided vehicles (AGV) are used to pick-up orders’ products.
• The ability to specify and carry out questionnaires/surveys about any intended topic (e.g.: about
a concrete product, a brand, the customer satisfaction regarding the system and/or regarding the
delivery process) in an easy and integrated way.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As in any traditional products order management system, there is a minimum core information
regarding customers and the products catalog that is required to the system work properly. Thus, it is
important that SPOMS provides the users with the ability of either (i) to create and manage
products/customers information directly and (ii) to import such information from external systems in
use in the organization where the system is being deployed.




Products basic information comprehends a unique internal code, a short and an extended description
as well as a more technical description, a set of photos, a brand name and reference. Moreover,
products can be organized by categories. By simplicity, a category consists only of an alphanumeric
code, and a description. Each product belongs mandatorily to a single category. To foster integration
with other information systems, a product also has (i) a mandatory barcode according to a valid coding
standard such as, for instance, EAN-13, UPC and (ii) an optional production code. Since products’
prices vary through time (e.g.: promotions) and by applicable taxes that differ from one
location/country to another, by now, it is just worth considering the current list price with and without
taxes. At last, it is required a mechanism to inhibit products (one or more) from being temporarily (or
permanently) ordered.



Regarding customers, the minimum required information is its name, a valid Value-Added Tax (VAT)
identifier, an email address, and a phone number. Optionally, customers might state their birthdate
and gender and have/manage several billing and delivering postal addresses. These addresses should
be kept updated by customers during the ordering process, namely while they are concluding a new
order. Every customer also has a unique identifier that is automatically generated by the system at
the customer registration time. In this regard, it is important noticing that a customer might register
his/herself on the system or, instead, be registered by an organization salesclerk, which may type or
import customer’ information from another system running into the organization. In the former
scenario, the customer must undergo an email/phone-based validation process to get his/her
credentials to access the system. In the latter scenario, no customer credentials are generated
automatically.
